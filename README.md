Paneer Butter Masala

Paneer butter masala or paneer makhni is also a staple dish in any wedding reception in India. It suits to almost everyone’s taste bud; hence an easy recipe to set in the menu. The flavor of butter makes the gravy so tasty that you could hardly do with just one serving; you will surely be reaching out for second or even third. But that’s okay as paneer butter masala is not an everyday dish. It is a celebratory affair as it is quite rich and heavy and I would never advice you to treat yourself with paneer butter masala every week!
